\section{Connections}
\begin{questions}{Sockets}
		\FIXME{answer these}

		When a client running a web browser connects to a web server, what is the source port of the connection?

		What is the destination port of the connection?

	\begin{questionAnswer}
		\qItem{Def}{A unix file type with duplex communication}
		\qItem{Use}{Communicating between processes}
		\qItem{List Sockets}{TCP/UDP \ra Socklist, all \ra netstat \& ss}
		\qItem{Listening TCP Sockets}{netstat -tl}
	\end{questionAnswer}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Attributes: Domain, Type, Protocol
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Domain \ra Address family (UNIX \ra AF\_UNIX, TCP/IP \ra AF\_INET, etc)
				\item Type \ra Communication characteristics
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Stream Sockets (SOCK\_STREAM) \ra Sequenced \& reliable 2 way byte stream. Large messages fragmented, transmitted, \& reassembled. Order of packets is guarenteed
						\item Datagram Sockets (SOCK\_DGRAM) \ra Doesn't establish \& maintain a connection. Unsequenced \& unreliable.
					\end{itemize}
				\item Protocol \ra UNIX and TCP/IP sockets dont require protocols \ra use 0 for the default
			\end{itemize}
		\item Communication Protocols
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item UDP \ra AF\_INET domain with SOCK\_DGRAM connection type
				\item TCP/IP \ra AF\_INET domain with SOCK\_STREAM connection type
				\item Others exist, but are less common
			\end{enumerate}
	\end{itemize}
\end{questions}

\begin{questions}{TCP/IP}
The application determines which communication protocol is more appro-
priate. On the Web, you normally do not want data to go missing during
transmission (a piece of text, image, or downloaded software might get lost,
with annoying to catastrophic results), hence TCP is the correct choice. For television or voice chat, it is usually preferrable to live with small breaks in the service (a pixellated picture or a brief burst of static) than for everything to grind to a halt while the system arranges for a missing datagram to be

	\begin{questionAnswer}
		\qItem{IP Packet}{A data packet sent by the TCP or UDP protocol. Contains header info and data. 20 header bytes and variable number of data bytes}
		\qItem{Local host}{Means \textit{this computer}, connects to the loopback address \ra 127.0.0.1 - 127.255.255.254 (IPv4) \& ::1 (IPv6)}
		\qItem{ARP}{Address resolution protocol. Maps an address (like IPv4 address) to a device (like a MAC address). Same for IPv6 this is done by NDP (see below)}
		\qItem{NDP}{Neighbor Discovery Protocol, removes necessity of DHCP for configuring hosts, although DHCPv6 does exist}
		\qItem{MAC Address}{Media access control address. Unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications at the data link layer of a network segment. Also known as Ethernet hardware address (EHA), hardware address or physical address. MAC addresses are supposedly unique world wide. Find current mac w/ arp}
		\qItem{Find an IP or site name}{dig \opt{site name}/\opt{ip address}}
		\qItem{Find site info from DNS}{whois \opt{site name}}
		\qItem{DHCP/DHCPv6}{Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. Standard network protocol for IP. Dynamically distributes network configuration parameters, such as IP addresses, for interfaces and services}
		\qItem{Default Gateway}{Path to reach all none local connections. Computer \ra Def Gateway (usually a router) \ra ... \ra destinations router \ra destination. Use rout to find gw address}
		\qItem{NAT}{Network address translation. Rerouting IP addresses so that there is only 1 internet routable IP for an entire private network. Used synonomously w/ IP masquarading. Used due to IPv4 exhaustion.}
		\qItem{IPoAC}{IP over Avian Carriers. IP packets carried by pigeon. Mike Tyson IT.}
		\qItem{Subnet mask}{Defines locally reachable connections. etc  192.168.178.0/24 means the first 24 bits are masked away and only the last 8 bits are locally reachable. So 192.168.178.0 to 192.168.178.255 can be reached locally}
		\qItem{CIDR}{Classless Inter-Domain Routing. Page 456 \uls. AKA supernetting\FIXME{EXPAND}}
		\qItem{Packet filter/firewall}{}
	\end{questionAnswer}

	IPs (ranges/subnets) reserved for private use/"non-routable" (RFC 1918)?
	\begin{tabular}{llll}
		\textbf{IP Class} &\textbf{From} &\textbf{To} &\textbf{CIDR}\\\hline
		Class A& 10.0.0.0& 10.255.255.255& 10.0.0.0/8\\
		Class B& 172.16.0.0& 172.31.255.255& 172.16.0.0/12\\
		Class C& 192.168.0.0& 192.168.255.255& 192.168.0.0/16\\ \hline
	\end{tabular}

How does a switch get a mac address?

What type of packet to discover a router?

A TCP connection on a network can be uniquely defined by 4 things. What are those things?

\begin{questions}{Tools}
	\begin{questionAnswer}
		\qItem{ifconfig}{Network configuration \& querying the setup of a network interface}
